# Start and stop the Prototype Kit

This guide explains how to start and stop the Prototype Kit on Windows, after you’ve installed it. 

If you have not already installed the Prototype Kit, [start at the beginning of the installation guide](/docs/get-started/windows-installation-guide/before-you-install). 

Open Git Bash and go to your prototype folder by entering `cd ~/Documents/projects/` followed by the name of your prototype, like this.

`cd ~/Documents/projects/name-of-your-prototype`.

To start running the Prototype Kit, enter `npm start`. After a few seconds, Git Bash should show a message that says “Listening on port 3000 url: http://localhost:3000”. This tells you the Prototype Kit is running successfully.

## Preview your prototype

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (opens in a new tab) in your web browser.

You should see the index page for your prototype.

This means your prototype is successfully running. 

## Stop the Prototype Kit

It’s fine to leave the Prototype Kit running for days or while your computer is asleep. If and when you want to stop it running, just press the ctrl and c keys together in Git Bash.

## Start prototyping

Once you have successfully installed and run the Prototype Kit, you are ready to start prototyping. To help with this you can:
